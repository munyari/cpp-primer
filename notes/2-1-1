int is an integer type guaranteed to be a minimum of 16 bits in length
(usually 32 in practice)
long is an integer type guaranteed to be a minimum of 32 bits in length
(usually 32 in practice)
long long is guaranteed to be a min of 64 bits in length
boolean has no set minimum size, could be represented by a single bit
A signed type can take both negative and positive values. In contrast,
an unsigned type can only take positive values, so it's maximum is twice as
large as that of a signed type
2.2
To calculate a mortgage, I would use an unsigned int for principal, unsigned int 
for payment and double for rate.
Principal and payment are non-negative, and we want fixed precision for those
rather than floating precision.
Rate is a decimal fractional value, so we typically want to store it as a double
